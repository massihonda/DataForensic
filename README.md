# DataForensic

This repository contains the code used to conduct a research project within the scope of a Data Forensic course. 

We implemented a tool to retrieve data from the blockchain using the Bitcoin API and model it as a network of transactions.

Our aim was to shed light into the transactions that involved a terroristic account. 

The repository is structured in the following way:

- Report Data Forensic.pdf contains the report of the analysis
- The folder 'crawler_with_heuristic' contains the file FinalBlockChain.ipynb which contains the source code of the analysis
